The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased and you need to start over for each word.</p><p>The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and spaces(<code>' '</code>). Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words. Words will be separated by a single space(<code>' '</code>).</p><h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3><pre><code>"String" =&gt; "StRiNg""Weird string case" =&gt; "WeIrD StRiNg CaSe"</code></pre>
