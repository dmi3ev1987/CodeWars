Your job is to return that string in a certain order that I will explain below:</p><p>Let's say you start with this: <code>"012345"</code></p><p>The first thing you do is reverse it:<code>"543210"</code><br>Then you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again:<code>"501234"</code><br>Then you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again:<code>"504321"</code><br>Then you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again:<code>"504123"</code></p><p>Continue this pattern until you have done every single position, and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular number, you would return:<code>"504132"</code></p><h1 id="input">Input:</h1><p>A string of length 1 - 1000</p><h1 id="output">Output:</h1><p>A correctly reordered string.</p>
